# tRNA
This project is to convert a C program I did as an undergrad in 93-95 into modern-day C#. The program predicts tRNA secondary structure from the primary structure. Not sure the chemistry is still accurate, but as a coding exercise, this should be a good challenge.

## Original C Program

In 1993 to 1995, I was a Chemistry undergrad at the Université de Moncton.  My summer research fellowship for those years included writing a C program to predict tRNA secondary structure from the primary structure.  GitHub Copilot added the following sentence: "The program was based on a paper by J.F. Miller and I. Tinoco Jr., "RNA Secondary Structure Prediction by Free Energy Minimization", Biochemistry, 1984, 23, 1508-1513."  I have no idea if that is true or not, as the source code does not cite that paper, and as far as I can remember, the work was based on the original work of my professor, Dr. Krysztof Jankowski.

## Modern C# Conversion

The goal of this project is to convert the original C code into modern-day C#.  The original C code is the file TRNA.C in the root Solution folder.
